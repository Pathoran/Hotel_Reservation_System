# Hotel_Reservation_System

This program will create a hotel reservation system using Java.  Different attributes of a room will be remembered (smoking/non-smoking, what floor, how many beds, etc) and considered when a customer is selecting a room.  Also the system will remember past customers and recommend rooms that are similar to the last room they rented.
